 <p> 
A portfolio website can cover a lot of bases. Generally speaking, professionals, agencies, freelancers and artists require a creative medium
 to display their work. This is why website portfolios, or other sites in which content is the number one focus, are some of the 
 most popular and valuable projects for people looking for inspiration for their own work.</p>
